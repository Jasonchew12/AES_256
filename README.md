How to Use AES

1. Choose a file to encrypt, for example, test.txt.

2. Place the file in the AES\FileToEncrypt directory.

3. In the project, open Main.cpp.

4. Change line 48 to the name of your file (e.g., test.txt).
    Optionally,
     change line 49 to any name you want for the output file, but it should end with .bin.
     On line 95, change the output file name to match the same file type as the original (e.g., testDecrypt.txt).

6. Finally, run the code.
